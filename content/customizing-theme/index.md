The `gatsby-starter-help-center` is built with [`typography-js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/typography-js/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/). This allows a high level of customization.

### Modifying the font

Edit `src/utils/typography.js` if you want to make changes to the fonts.

### Modifying the colors

Edit `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` if you want to adapt the colors, spacings and so on.

### Customize your help center

Now that you know about modifying the theme, you can continue to learn how to customize your help center in any of these articles:

- [Adding your own logo](/articles/customizing-brand-logo)
- [Changing the language](/articles/customizing-locale)
- [Working with icons](/articles/customizing-icons)

Or you can go straight to [Deploying the Help Center](/articles/deploy).
