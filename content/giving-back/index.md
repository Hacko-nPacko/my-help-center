If you are using the free help center for one of your projects, please let me know about it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center/issues). You can just link to your help center, or even introduce your project. It's always fun to see what the help center is used for.

Once you're up and running, you can add your Help Center to the [examples list](https://github.com/dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center#-examples) on our README.

Otherwise I'd be happy if you [star this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center).

This project has been created and is maintained by [Dominik Ferber](https://www.dferber.de/). I'm available for frontend development work. It's best if you [send me an email](mailto:dominik.ferber+gatsbystarterhelpcenter@gmail.com) in case you want to work with me.
