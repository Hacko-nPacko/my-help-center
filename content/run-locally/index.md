_This tutorial will show you how to run the help center on your machine. At the end of this step, you will have the help center running locally. The next section then shows how to edit the content. And the final step shows how to deploy the help center to the internet, so that anyone can access it._

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you've completed [the previous step](/articles/setup).

In the previous step, you cloned the [gatsby-starter-help-center](https://github.com/dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center) into a folder called `help-center` by running `gatsby new help-center dferber90/gatsby-starter-help-center`.

### Run the help center locally

Now, change into the newly created `help-center` folder by running `cd help-center`.

You can now execute `npm run develop` to start Gatsby locally. This will run your help center. Watch the terminal output to see when Gatsby started. Then open [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) to see your new page locally.

### Adding an article

Read the next chapter to [learn how to add your first article to the help center](/articles/create-article).
